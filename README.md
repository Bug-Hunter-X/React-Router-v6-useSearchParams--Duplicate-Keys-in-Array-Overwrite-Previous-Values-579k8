This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6's `useSearchParams` hook when handling arrays of search parameters with duplicate keys.  The bug causes data loss because only the last occurrence of a key is preserved.  The provided solution shows how to avoid this by using an object to manage search parameters, ensuring all values are correctly represented in the URL.
