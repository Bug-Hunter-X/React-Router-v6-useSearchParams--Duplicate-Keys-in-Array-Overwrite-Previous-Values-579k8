In React Router Dom v6, using the `useSearchParams` hook with an array of search parameters can lead to unexpected behavior.  If you attempt to update the search parameters using the `setSearchParams` function with an array that includes duplicate keys, only the last occurrence of the key will be preserved in the URL. This can cause data loss or incorrect state management if your application relies on the presence of multiple values with the same key. For example, if you are managing a list of selected items with IDs, duplicate IDs would overwrite previous selections.
